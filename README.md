- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, primarily, although I'm playing with web and app development because it makes visualizing more enjoyable!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for data analytics, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things I'm not sure yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
